I am short and old. I play the French horn. I have a daughter who is pretty cool for some definition of the word cool.
I have a husband and a cat, neither of whom is cool, but who are still pretty great. I am prone to frequent bursts of
sarcasm.

My favorite animal is the human being. This may also be my least favorite.

My favorite color is red probably.
